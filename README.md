# Crypto rates  
Crypto rates is a simple project that I made in order to discover the Javascript framework Vue.js. 
For the front-end I obviously used Vue.js and for the back-end I used Node.js with [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express).   
To easily deploy the project I used [ZEIT](https://zeit.co/) for the front and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for the back-end.
