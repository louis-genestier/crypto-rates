# Front-end

This is the front-end part of the project.  
I used the vue.js CLI.

## Installation

```bash
yarn install
```  
You will also need to set up your .env.
```
VUE_APP_API_URL=
```
`VUE_APP_API_URL` is your API endpoint.

## Usage

For developement:
```bash
yarn serve
```  
For production: 
```bash
 yarn build
```
